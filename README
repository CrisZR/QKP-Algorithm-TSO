# QKP-Algorithm-TSO

This project implements an algorithm to solve instances of the Quadratic Knapsack Problem (QKP) using selection heuristics and local improvement (swap 1-1).

## Project Structure

- `script_swap_1_1.py`: Main script that loads instances, runs the algorithm, and displays results.
- `QKPGroupI/`: Folder containing problem instance files in `.txt` format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Numpy

Install the required dependencies with:

```sh
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

1. Place the problem instances in the `QKPGroupI` folder.
2. Run the main script:

```sh
python script_swap_1_1.py
```

3. Select the index of the instance you want to solve when prompted.

## Algorithm Description

- **Data loading:** Reads the instance and extracts problem parameters.
- **Initial selection:** Selects items based on individual profitability.
- **Local improvement:** Applies the swap 1-1 heuristic to improve the solution.
- **Results:** Displays selected items, total profit, total weight, and checks solution feasibility.
